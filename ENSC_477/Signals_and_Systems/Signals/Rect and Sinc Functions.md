Rect also exist in 2D, here they are

The 2D rect is the product of two 1D rects:

You can select a part of a signal centered around ($\xi , \eta$) by:

X and Y stretches the window to width X and Y. It is not the area of rect that is always 1, rather it is the height, this allows you to choose specific sections of f(x, y) to see.

Sinc also exists in 2D, useful because it is related to rect 1D or 2D in the other domain (freq vs time):

made from product of two 1D Sincs:

Looks like this in 1D:
