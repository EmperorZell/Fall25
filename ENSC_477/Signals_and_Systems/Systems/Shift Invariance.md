A system is shift invariant if an arbitrary translation of the input results in an identical translation of the output. In other words it is not the absolute shift that matters but the relative shift.

If a system is both linear and shift invariant, the [[Impulse Response|PSF]] is reduced to a 2D signal instead of 4D:
