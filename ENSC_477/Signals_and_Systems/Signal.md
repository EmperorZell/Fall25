Above are 2 ways a signal could be visualized, the left side is more of a "mathematical representation" and the right side is more of an intuitive visualization.

**left**: graphs a signal (f(x,y)) at each point (x, y).
**right**: graphs an image (f) for each picture element (pixel) (x, y) 

3D representation called a volume element (voxel)
