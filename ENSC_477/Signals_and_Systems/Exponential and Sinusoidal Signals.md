Here is the 2D complex exponential signal:

$u_0$ and $v_0$ are real-value parameters and $j^2$ = -1. These parameters will be referred to as the fundamental frequencies. The units are inverse of x and y.

As always, this can be decomposed into a real and an imaginary part using sinusoids:

The sinusoids again, can also be represented as exponentials:

$u_0$ and $v_0$ affect the oscillating behaviour of the sinusoidal signals in the x and y directions (respectively). Small values result in slower oscillations than fast values. Here are some examples:
