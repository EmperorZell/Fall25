Sometimes it is easier or better to see what happens along a line, for this we have the line impulse function:
![[LineImpulse.png]]
The impulse evaluates a "0" whenever $xcos\theta + ysin\theta$ is equal to $\ell$

$\ell$ is the set of points defined by:
![[Line.png]]
The angle $\theta$ is w.r.t. the x-axis and this line is $\ell$ distance away from origin
